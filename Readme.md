This Repo showcases the progress of learning of Python in different contexts: OOP programming, Web/API Development & Data Science in 2022.

The Curriculum was provided by https://www.appbrewery.co/ 
I can highly recommend the appbrewery python course.
The functionality might be limited, as code was writte using SDKs in 2022. Also because some endpoints and some custom settings are removed.

Never hardcode any sensible information. The code is just a learn project and is not advisable in security context.
